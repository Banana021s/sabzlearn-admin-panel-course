# simple panel admin template without any logic
📍 This repo is for students of sabzlearn 20 javascript projects. I made it for you guys as a final project to do. this panel admin is raw and it doesn't have any javascript logic. Because it's your responsibility to add it 😉🤝😄 if you have any question you can ask on the Q/A panel 🤓
